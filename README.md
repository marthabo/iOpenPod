## Features

### 🎵 Sync Music From Any Format
Drop in any file format and iOpenPod transcodes whatever the iPod can't play natively into ALAC or AAC. Converted files are cached so repeat syncs are fast.

### 📻 Podcasts
Subscribe to podcasts right inside iOpenPod with the built-in podcast manager. Search, subscribe, download episodes, and sync them to your iPod.

### 🎧 ListenBrainz Scrobbling
Sign into ListenBrainz and your listening history gets scrobbled automatically every time you sync.

### 📚 More Than Just Music
Audiobooks, movies, and TV shows are all supported. iOpenPod handles the different media types so your iPod sorts them correctly.

### 🖱️ Drag and Drop
Don't care about keeping your PC and iPod perfectly in sync? Just drag files into the app and they'll land on your iPod. No fingerprinting or file tracking.

### 📊 Play Counts & Ratings
Listen on your iPod, plug it in, and your play counts, ratings, and skip counts can sync back to your PC library.

### 🖼️ Album Art Just Works
Art gets extracted from your files, resized, and written in the iPod's native RGB565 format. No extra steps.

### ✅ Review Before You Commit
Every sync shows you exactly what's happening, adds, removes, metadata updates, all with checkboxes for each item. Nothing changes until you say so.

## For Developers

Want to help make iOpenPod? Here's how to get a dev environment running.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+**
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** (Python package manager)
- **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** (for transcoding)
- **[Chromaprint](https://acoustid.org/chromaprint)** (for fingerprinting)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheRealSavi/iOpenPod.git
cd iOpenPod
uv sync
uv run python main.py
```

That's it. `uv sync` installs all dependencies into a virtual environment automatically.

### Project Layout

└── main.py                 # Entry point
```

### How Sync Works

The sync engine matches tracks between your PC and iPod using acoustic fingerprints ([Chromaprint](https://acoustid.org/chromaprint)). This means it can identify the same song even after re-encoding, format conversion, or metadata changes.

1. Scan both the PC media folder and iPod's iTunesDB
2. Compute or read cached fingerprints for each track
3. Diff by fingerprint to classify: new, removed, changed, or matched
4. Present the sync plan for review
5. Copy/transcode files, update the database, sync artwork and play counts
6. Rebuild the iTunesDB binary with the correct device-specific checksum

### Areas Where Help Is Needed

- **Real hardware testing** - Every iPod is a little different.
- **macOS and Linux testing** - Primary dev is on Windows
- **Bug reports** - Open an issue with steps to reproduce

Please open an issue before starting major changes so we can coordinate, or [join the discord server](https://discord.gg/9Yy499Tf5d).
