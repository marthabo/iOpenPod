"""MHBD Writer — Write complete iTunesDB database files.

This is the top-level writer that assembles all components into
a valid iTunesDB (or iTunesCDB for Nano 5G+) file.

Dataset write order (matches libgpod):
  mhbd (database header, 244 bytes)
    mhsd type 1 (tracks dataset)
      mhlt (track list)
        mhit (track) x N
          mhod (string) x M
    mhsd type 3 (podcasts dataset) — MUST appear between types 1 and 2
      mhlp (playlist list) — same data as type 2
    mhsd type 2 (playlists dataset)
      mhlp (playlist list)
        mhyp (master playlist) — REQUIRED, always first
          mhod types 52/53 (library indices)
          mhip (track ref) x N
        mhyp (user playlist) x M
    mhsd type 4 (albums dataset)
      mhla (album list)
        mhia (album item) x N
    mhsd type 8 (artist list)
      mhli (artist list)
        mhii (artist item) x N
          mhod type 300 (artist name)
    mhsd type 6 (empty stub — mhlt with 0 children)
    mhsd type 10 (empty stub — mhlt with 0 children)
    mhsd type 5 (smart playlists dataset)
      mhlp (smart playlist list)
